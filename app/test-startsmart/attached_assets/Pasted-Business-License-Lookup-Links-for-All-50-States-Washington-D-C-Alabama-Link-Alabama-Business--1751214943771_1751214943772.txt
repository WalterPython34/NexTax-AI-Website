Notes and Guidance
State Variations: Many states do not have a single "business license" lookup because general business licenses are often issued at the local (city/county) level. The links above primarily point to business entity searches (for registered corporations, LLCs, etc.) or professional license lookups. For local licenses, you may need to contact specific municipalities.

Professional Licenses: For industries like construction, healthcare, or real estate, check state-specific licensing boards (e.g., contractors, medical boards). Many states have separate lookup tools for these.

Washington, D.C. Specifics: The Scout platform is the primary tool for verifying Basic Business Licenses in D.C. For additional details, such as corporate registrations, use CorpOnline. If you need to verify a contractor’s license, the Contractor Rating System on Scout is useful.
Limitations: Some states’ lookup tools may not include all licenses (e.g., professional licenses may not list addresses). If you don’t find what you need, contact the state’s licensing authority or check with local governments.
Third-Party Services: Sites like Harbor Compliance or BusinessLicenses.com offer assistance with license searches across states but may charge fees. Use official state resources for free access.
