Consider fine-tuning to make answers more action-oriented (e.g., “Click here to file your Articles with LARA” with an embedded link).

Add a “Save to Roadmap” button for relevant tasks mentioned in chat.

2. Progress Roadmap
✅ What’s Working:

Great summary UI with task tracking and % completion.

Smart call-to-action: “Create Business Profile” to personalize tasks.

Add tooltips or expanders for each phase to explain what’s involved.

Consider an “Import from AI Chat” or “Sync with AI Guidance” function.
