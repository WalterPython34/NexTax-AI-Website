💡 Summary For Replit
"We need the Prompt Playground to transition from static PDFs to an interactive in-app tool. Based on tier (Free, Pro, Premium), users should be able to browse, copy, favorite, and run prompts directly into the AI Chat. Premium users should also be able to edit and save their own custom prompts. Let’s use a tab-based layout with tier gating and backend prompt libraries per tier."
