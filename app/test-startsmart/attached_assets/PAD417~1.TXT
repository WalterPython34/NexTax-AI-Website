To automate the Lean Canvas generation, we’ll treat it as a structured one-page business model and use these 9 standard blocks:

✅ Lean Canvas - Section Breakdown for AI Generation
Here are the 9 Lean Canvas blocks we need to collect from the user:

Problem – What top 1–3 problems does your startup solve?

Customer Segments – Who are your target customers (personas)?

Unique Value Proposition (UVP) – Your clear, compelling statement of differentiation.

Solution – Outline of the core solution to each problem.

Channels – How you reach your customers (marketing/sales).

Revenue Streams – How do you make money?

Cost Structure – What are the main fixed and variable costs?

Key Metrics – What are the critical metrics that define success?

Unfair Advantage – What can’t easily be copied or bought?
