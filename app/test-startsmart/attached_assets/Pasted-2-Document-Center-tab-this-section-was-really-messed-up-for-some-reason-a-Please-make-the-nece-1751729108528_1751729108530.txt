a.	Please make the necessary corrections to fix the below issues:
i.	SS-4 EIN Form (Under Tax & Finance section): I want to change the tier to Premium ($79/mo) for access to the “Create with AI” button, with no time limit, so that they will get EIN preparation for $79 (at a discount from NexTax Website price special benefit for Premium tier members).  
1.	Also please make sure that a link to my Typeform quiz appears for them to fill out and note above the link, “That by filling out the below questionnaire, your form will be auto generated, sent to you via email with instructions for you to review and sign, and a copy will then be provided to NexTax.AI where we will proceed to get your EIN for you from the IRS and provide you with a final copy of your SS-4 form complete with your new EIN number at the top of the form.”

1.	Under “Create with AI” when the “Generate Chart” button is clicked after the questions are answered, I get a Red error message stating that” Generation Failed – Failed to generate chart of accounts. Please try again.” Please fix so that the excel file generates as it was during testing.
