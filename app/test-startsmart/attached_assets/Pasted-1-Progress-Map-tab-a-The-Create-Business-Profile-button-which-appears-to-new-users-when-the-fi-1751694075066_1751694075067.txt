a.	Please make the necessary corrections to fix the below issues:

1.	Also please make sure that a link to my Typeform quiz appears for them to fill out and note above the link, “That by filling out the below questionnaire, your form will be auto generated, sent to you via email with instructions for you to review and sign, and a copy will then be provided to NexTax.AI where we will proceed to get your EIN for you from the IRS and provide you with a final copy of your SS-4 form complete with your new EIN number at the top of the form.”
