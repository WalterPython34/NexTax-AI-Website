🚀 2. “Create with AI” = Pro Plan (✅ Good)
That button is working as it should. Here’s how to enhance:

Add Tooltip or Label:
“Let our AI draft your document with your business profile.”

✅ Smart feature to lock behind Pro, as it provides real-time productivity.

👑 3. “Premium” Button — Needs Rethinking
Right now it duplicates the Pro button and adds no unique value, so here's what you should do:

🔄 Replace “Premium” Button with:
🛎 “Let NexTax Help” → Link to your https://www.nexTax.ai/pricing

Label:

“Need expert help completing this document? Let NexTax assist you directly.”

This is your white-glove upsell path — Premium tier users may want:

Legal/accounting help

Filing services

Pitch deck review

💡 Bonus Improvements
🧠 Smart Personalization on Popup:
When user clicks “Create with AI,” ask:

“Want to use your business profile details to pre-fill this?”

[Yes, pre-fill] [No, start fresh]

🧭 Add Path to Roadmap:
Let users save created docs directly to Progress Tracker:

“Add this task to your Business Launch Roadmap?”
