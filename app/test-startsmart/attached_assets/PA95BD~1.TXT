StartSmart Compliance Center Enhancement Specification

Objective:
Improve the utility and automation of the Compliance Center by adding logic-driven task generation, state-specific due dates, smarter completion tracking, and AI/document integration.

1. Onboarding Enhancements (for All Users)

Add onboarding questions:

State of formation (dropdown)

Fiscal year-end month (default: December)

Store these values to calculate:

Annual report due dates

Income tax deadlines

State filing reminders

2. Auto-Generated Compliance Tasks (Based on Entity Type + State)

Business Registration

Articles of Organization → Mark complete if downloaded or generated in Doc Center

Registered Agent Appointed → Manual check or auto-check if answered in onboarding

Annual Report → Auto-created annually based on state rules

Tax Compliance

Federal EIN Obtained → Auto-check if EIN Assistant used

State Tax Registration → Trigger if onboarding includes retail/sales activity

Federal Income Tax Return (Form 1120/1065/Schedule C) → Based on entity type

Federal Estimated Payments → Auto-create 4 tasks: April, June, Sept, Jan

State Sales Tax Returns → Recurring (monthly or quarterly) depending on state logic or user preference

Licenses & Permits

General Business License → Manual or city-specific autofill suggestion

Professional License → Trigger based on onboarding role/industry

Health Department Permit → Trigger if NAICS or onboarding indicates food/health

Employment Compliance

Workers' Compensation → Manual check + state law tooltip

Employment Posters → Download button + mark when posted

941 Payroll Tax Returns → Auto-create 4 deadlines: April, July, October, January (for W-2 businesses)

3. Smart Sync Logic with Other Modules

Document Center:

Mark related tasks "Generated with AI" when user creates documents (e.g., Operating Agreement, EIN)

AI Chat:

Allow chat to add, check, or explain compliance tasks

Examples:

"What filings are due this month?"

"Remind me to file 941 next quarter"

Roadmap:

Sync compliance tasks into the Progress Roadmap

Add labels: "Tax", "Legal", "State", etc.

4. User Controls and Flexibility

All tasks should be editable:

Due date override

Mark complete manually

Add custom reminders

5. UI Enhancements

Color-coded task chips: Complete / In Progress / Overdue

Add percentage by category (Tax, Legal, Employment, etc.)

Tooltips or links for each state requirement (Annual Report, Sales Tax)

Implementation Suggestion:
Phase 1:

Add state/FY onboarding inputs

Auto-create federal tasks + allow user editing

Phase 2:

Add state-level logic + recurring task engine

Phase 3:

Sync with Doc Center and Chat

Launch notification engine (email or push)

Goal:
Transform the Compliance Center from a static checklist into a dynamic, intelligent assistant that keeps new business owners ahead of deadlines automatically.
